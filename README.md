              <p>New 2023 Toyota Prius for US market is coming to dealerships in January 2023 and it will be available in three grades. Here you can see the limit to the trim finished in wind chill Pearl Colour features such as the <b>12.3 inch GPL</b> premium audio touch screen display fixed class roof heated and ventilated front seats heated steering wheel poverty lift back and digital key come standard on the limited trim for 2023. Prius models will come standard with the latest <b><a href="https://motokeeda.com/toyota-innova-hycross-car-features/" target="_main">Toyota</a></b> safety sense generation <b>TSS 3.0</b> More powerful hybrid system delivers 60% more horse covered with up to <b>196 horsepower</b> MSRP has also been announced And for the trim. It is 34,465 dollars and 35,865 for the old wheel drive version.</p>
              <br>
              <p>When you make a decision to buy a hybrid you’ve kind of given up on fun the Prius has always been about showing others that you care about trees Mother Nature and things like plush green grass and butterflies. Driving a Prius lets you be a little pretentious while letting all non-hybrid drivers know that you’re just destroying the planet at a slower rate than they are. It’s never been about looking good and going fast. Until now this is the 2023 <b><a href="https://motokeeda.com/toyota-prius-new-car/" target="_main">Toyota Prius</a></b> It looks really good and this one can actually go faster than you can walk Lets check it out.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Toyota Prius Colors</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Toyota Prius <b>7 Colours</b> in India</p>
              <br>
              <li>Super White</li>
              <li>Emotional Red</li>
              <li>Silver Metallic</li>
              <li>Dark Blue Mica Metallic</li>
              <li>Attitude Black Mica</li>
              <li>Grey Metallic</li>
              <li>White Pearl Crystal Shine</li>
              <br>
              <h3>Exterior</h3>
              <br>
              <p>So yeah you no longer have to be embarrassed to drive a Prius and not only because of the upgrades and the performance department because this thing actually looks pretty good. It’s still got a lift back design but it now sits lower and is a little wider. The 2023 Prius roof finds its 2 inches lower than the algorithm model in the back is about an inch wider. On the front end you have a low slung hood But the standout design element to me are these LED headlamps and day time ring lights that are standard across the whole line-up.</p>
              <br>
              <div id="img2">
                <img src="https://motokeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/toyota-prius-infographic-image.webp" alt="Toyota Prius Infographic">
              </div>
              <p>They really give the new Prius a lot of front character. from this side you’ve got some nice creases and body lines But guess what You can now get 19 inch wheels on a Prius The base LE gets 17 inch wheels but excellent above your working with 19 inch wheels And they don’t look boring You actually have a nice looking set of wheels on a Prius right from the production line That’s awesome Move over to the back And this is probably my favourite angle of the new Prius You’ve got a standard LED tail light part that runs across the whole rear end which every brain is doing these days And I’m here for it here on the Prius and helps give it stands for sure.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Cargo Capacity</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Alright let’s check out the cargo capacity You do have a power lift gate and you can open it by using a button located right underneath the <b><a href="https://motokeeda.com/category/toyota/" target="_main">Toyota</a></b> logo And once you get it open you have a total of 20.3 cubic feet behind the 2nd row And do you have 6040 split rear seats If you need some more loading capacity.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>Interior</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Alright so let’s check out the interior of the new Prius and once you get in here you’ll see that Toyota has really stepped up their game this no longer feels like an economy hybrid. There’s a good amount of use of high quality materials in the upper areas Of course once you move to the lower parts you have some hard plastic but that’s to be expected in the segment. As for comfort these seats are outstanding I’ve been driving this around all day and I’ve had no complaints with the amount of support or comfort they provide. And as always the visibility is pretty solid from the driver’s point of view.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The XLE gets heated front seats as standard while the limited gets heated and ventilated seats as standard. Both of those terms also get a heated strength will have standard if you want heated seeds in the back those are optional for an extra $350.00 and you can only have them if you go for the limited trim. And while we’re back here let’s check out the legroom in the 2nd row I do want to point out that the rear doors on the new priors are actually automatic releases You just put your hand right here and push a button and the door open, Not sure why but that’s a thing now.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Alright let’s hop into the tech for the 2023 Prius Got is the giant vertical display and the gage cluster that uses sip you now have a cleaner layout to the whole dash with this giant 12.3 inch touch screen display that houses tote as new infotainment system Keep in mind though that you don’t get this larger touch screen display on the base LE model And it is optional on the XLE for an extra $610.</p>
              <br>
              <div id="img3">
                <img src="https://motokeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/toyota-prius-intirior-looks-800x450.webp" alt="Toyota1">
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>If you don’t go for this massive display you just get a smaller 8 inch display However both get the same infotainment system that we’ve seen on all new Toyota models. That means you get wireless Apple and car plate and wireless Android auto across all trims of the Prius and again navigation is optional as a part of a subscription service. I don’t think many people will end up getting because they will just use Apple car play Google Maps or Apple maps. But yeah overall the system is pretty easy to use and the performance is pretty quick as well. I’m moving over to the gage cluster I am happy that you now have a gage cluster right in front of the driver instead of the centre like on the outgoing Prius.</p>
              <br>
              <p>However I’m still not a fan of how it’s all laid out Apparently you’re supposed to look over the steering wheel and not through it, but in either instance you’re not able to see all the info that’s there. let’s talk driver assist tech really quick The new Prius comes standard with <b>Toyota </b>safety sense 3.0 meaning everything is essentially standard You get adaptive cruise control lane departure alert lane tracing assist, So it’ll actually stay cantered automatically in lanes You also get a preclusion system with pedestrian detection. roadside recognition and much more As far as the camera game goes you’re working with the rear-view camera as standard across the board If you want to strand view <b>360 degree camera </b>you’ll have to go for the limited and pay an extra <b>$1085</b> And that will also give you advanced park assist. And you can also add all this digital rear view mirror for an extra $200.</p>

              <p>I wish the leg room was a little bit more, You’ll get an inch and a half more but I wish it was a little bit more spacious, I wish you had power seats for the passenger not just the driver. And that’s really it there’s not much more that I don’t like Oh and the fact that you have to subscribe to get navigation that still bothers me. Now what I picked this over the Corolla Hybrid or the Camry hybrid I would definitely get it over the Corolla hybrid but if you’re looking for a large sedan the canary hybrid is probably a better buy and I think that gets up to 52 miles per gallon combined.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Price</h2>
              <br>
              <p>Let’s start with the Pricing details, so you know what you are working with as we go along on this tour the base Prius LE starts at 27,450 Now to get into a nicely equipped one you want to be at the XLE trim which starts at $30,895 And then if you want to go all out in a Prius you can go for the limited which starts at around $34,000 Going for all will drive on any trim will cost you an extra $1400.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>Final Thought</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Well everyone is gunning it towards electric cars The Prius is sticking with a simple formula. A gasoline engine combined with electric motor that works together to double the fuel economy you get from a regular gas powered car. There’s no plugging in and waiting around for the battery to recharge. Most EV are trying very hard to maintain a range of over 300 miles.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>The Prius can easily get over 500 miles. I mean this model right here that I’m driving has been driven around all day and it still has more than 310 miles left. And that range isn’t affected by whether or not if I use the heated seats the air conditioning or decide to listen to some music. With a sleek new exterior design a more premium interior with upgraded tech the new Prius is pretty impressive. Honestly the new Prius is not just a solid hybrid it’s a solid car either way Thanks for reading us, I’ll catch you guys at the next one Take care Peace and again I don’t hate Tesla but the new Prius looks much better than the Tesla Model 3. I still stand by the fact that Tesla Model 3 looks like a turtle this looks much better than the Tesla Model 3.</p>
